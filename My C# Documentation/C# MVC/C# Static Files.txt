----------STATIC FOR C#----------
Static files (css, javascript, images) aren't compiled the way that our .cs files are, 
    and by default they aren't accessible to our app while it's running. 
In order to add styling and javascript to our apps,
    we need to provide some additional configuration to our Startup class.

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    // other configurations
    // We will now add the UseStaticFiles() middleware, which allows our app to access our static files.
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
}
*********************************
ASP.NET Core Mvc apps will look for static files in a folder called wwwroot 
    which we'll need to create ourselves within our main project folder. 
By convention wwwroot should contain subfolders for different types of static content. 
For example all of our css files should be in a subfolder called "css":
*********************************
Now that our application is configured properly, 
    we can start using those static files in our views. 
Because our app knows by default where to look for our 
    static files we only need to specify their location in relation to wwwroot:
*********************************
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset='utf-8'>
        <title>Index</title>
        // In this context '~' refers to the wwwroot folder
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello ASP.NET Mvc!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
