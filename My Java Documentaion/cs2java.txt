*************some basic differences***********

--------------Strings & Classes--------
    Strings as a type are actually a Class
    they are not Primitive Types

    Classes by Java convention are Always uppercased

    By contrast in C# some classes can be used lowercased

    In C# you could say something like:

        public static string giveMeAString()
        {
            return string toReturn = "Some Generic String"
        }

    However in Java this same statement would be written

        public static String giveMeAString()
        {
            return String toReturn = "Some Generic String"
        }

    While confusing at first, this does serve a purpose
        to more explicitly state that you are calling on a class
        rather than declaring a primitive type which refers generally to
        physical storage

--------------Generics and Lists--------

    Another confusing difference is the 
        use of the term List

    In C# declaring a List is very simple
        Ex: List<string>

    However the Java declaration looks more like this
        Ex: ArrayList<String>
            or
        Ex: LinkedList<String>

    There is a term called List in Java
        however it is used like an interface
        where an ArrrayList inherits from

    Class ArrayList() extends List
    {
        not the actual class, just an example
    }
