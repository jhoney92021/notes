************New Project***********
Let's use NPM to create our first Express server:
Step 1: Create an empty folder called HelloExpress

Step 2: Navigate inside that folder in your terminal and type 
****************
npm init -y
****************
        You should now see a file inside of HelloExpress called package.json.  If you open this file, the contents should look something like this:

Step 3: Letâ€™s now install express from the command-line by executing the following command (important: you must be in the same folder as your package.json file)

****************
npm install express --save
****************

Developers eventually got annoyed at typing --save all the time and 
    so the npm install command will execute with the 
    --save option by default now, allowing us to type instead:

****************
npm install express
****************

Furthermore, we can also simply type the letter
     "i" instead of the word install to shorten the syntax further:
****************
npm i express
****************
